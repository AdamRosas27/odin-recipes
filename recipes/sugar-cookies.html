    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Sugar cookies that are crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Do
      not try to roll these cookies out, they are meant to be shaped or dropped.
      This recipe can easily be made into snickerdoodle cookies by rolling the
      dough in cinnamon-sugar before baking.

        When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the dough into walnut-sized balls and roll the balls in remaining
        1/4 cup of sugar. Place cookies 2 inches apart onto ungreased cookie
        sheets and flatten slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until lightly browned at
        the edges. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before
        removing to a wire rack to cool completely.
